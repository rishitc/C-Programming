[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/205a7391efe649a28196b459d27b8470)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/rishit.c/C-Programming?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=rishitc/C-Programming&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This repository contains all the programs related to the C programming  language.

Every program has its own folder to better explain how it works. I'll try adding LaTeX articles to each program to make understanding it easier.

This repository is a mix of easy and hard programs and everything in between.

Index of Programs in this repository:

 1. Vector Pooling
     - This program takes and input a vector and a window size and the performs vector pooling and returns the condensed vector. Visit its folder to find out more.
 2. VM
      1. This program creates a simple toy Virtual Machine which supports a simple set of instructions, has a stack as well as a few registers. It does not target any specific computer architecture at the moment.
